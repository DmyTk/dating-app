## Get Started

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Create a development build locally and run it

```sh
# For iOS
npm run ios
# For Android
npm run android
```

This will create a development build, install it on the simulator, and open it.

## Linting

- `npm run format` - automatically fixes code style according to prettier rules
- `npm run lint` - checks for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript errors
- `npm run lint:js` - runs ESLint check
- `npm run lint:ts` - runs TypeScript check

CI/CD pipeline automatically runs linter checks on push and pull requests.
